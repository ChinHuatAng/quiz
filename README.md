Python + Docker Quiz
====================

**Goal:** Implement unsigned 16-bit and 32-bit data types in Python which passes the attached test cases, then build the smallest possible container to allow anyone to run the test cases.

**Note:** Don't use NumPy (http://www.numpy.org) as it would take away all the fun :-)

**Tip:** Some basic Python concepts or software development practices that might be helpful: operator/method overloading, object-oriented programming, test-driven development.
